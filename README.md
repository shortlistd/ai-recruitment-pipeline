# AI Recruitment Pipeline

An AI recruitment pipeline automates early-stage hiring by connecting
candidate sourcing, interviewing, and evaluation into a single,
coordinated workflow.

shortlistd implements an AI recruitment pipeline using autonomous
AI agents and large language models, with humans remaining responsible
for final hiring decisions.

## What Is an AI Recruitment Pipeline?

An AI recruitment pipeline is a system that:

- Translates job requirements into skill models
- Identifies relevant candidates at scale
- Conducts structured first-round interviews
- Evaluates candidates consistently
- Produces decision-ready shortlists

Unlike traditional ATS systems, AI recruitment pipelines actively
perform hiring work rather than simply managing applicants.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Job Definition and Skill Modeling
Roles are translated into structured skill and experience requirements
rather than keyword-based descriptions.

### 2. Candidate Discovery
Candidates are sourced using semantic relevance across large
professional profile datasets.

### 3. AI-Led Interviews
AI agents conduct structured first-round interviews using conversational
interfaces, including voice capability where appropriate.

### 4. Evaluation and Scoring
Candidate responses are assessed using predefined rubrics and normalized
across the applicant pool.

### 5. Shortlist Delivery
Hiring teams receive ranked, interview-ready candidates for final review.

## Human-in-the-Loop Design

AI recruitment pipelines are not fully autonomous.

Humans remain involved in:
- Reviewing interviews
- Validating candidate fit
- Making hiring decisions
- Monitoring system performance

## AI Recruitment Pipeline vs Traditional Hiring

Traditional hiring relies on manual sourcing, CV screening, and recruiter
coordination.

AI recruitment pipelines reduce manual effort by automating repeatable
tasks while preserving human judgment where it matters most.
